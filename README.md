This is an Arduino library for communicating with ROBO Pro software over USB. 

The fx1-arduino-parser is a component that may be useful for a variety of projects, including educational tools. I want developers to be able to play with fx1-arduino-parser, give feedback, and think of novel uses for it. All the code is free and open source. Enjoy!
